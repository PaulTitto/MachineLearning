### Pass the TensorFlow Developer Certification Exam by Google. Become an AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning expert!

The goal of this course is to teach me all the skills necessary for me to go and pass this exam and get your TensorFlow Certification from Google so i'm can display it on your resume, LinkedIn, Github and other social media platforms to truly make me stand out.

#### Why should I learn TensorFlow and get the TensorFlow Developer Certificate?

Here's the top 3 reasons why we think you should learn TensorFlow:

1. **Lots of jobs available:** Used by major companies like Google, Airbnb, Uber, DeepMind, Intel, IBM, Twitter means there is huge job demand for TensorFlow developers. TensorFlow is outgrowing other popular ML tools like PyTorch in the job market.
2. **High demand** = High salary: TensorFlow developers earn US$148,000 on average with some earning over US$200,000 according to 2022 statistics from ZipRecruiter.
3. **Old fashioned FUN:** Learning TensorFlow allows you to build deep learning models for a range of tasks such as regression, computer vision (finding patterns in images), natural language processing (finding patterns in text) and time series forecasting (predicting future trends given a range of past events). That's pretty damn awesome!
